# The URLd

The URLd (URL directory), or as in 'The World', was a quick side project by myself and [Angelo Ashmore](https://github.com/angeloashmore), that aimed to be a light-weight place to share and discuss interesting links, and “befriend” (follow) or message interesting curators of links. It aimed to be effectively what [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) is today.

It was later re-written in node.js by [Craig Condon](https://github.com/crcn), which will be available later.
